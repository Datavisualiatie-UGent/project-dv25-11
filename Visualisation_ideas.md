# Visualisation ideas

This document contains a list of ideas for visualisations that could be created using the StackOverflow Developer Survey data. The data is available in the `src/data/` directory.

Due to the amount of data available, I will limit the number of visualisations to 1 per main category of data. The main categories are:

- Developer profile
- Technology
- Work Experience

## Developer profile

Interactive visualistion where the user can select a country and see the distribution of developer types in that country in a stacked bar chart/waffle chart.
This should be a combination of the data visualized [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#education) and [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#5-geography)

## Technology

This visualisation will be a verbatim copy of the one shown [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#2-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).

## Work Experience

This visualisation will be a verbatim copy of the one shown [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/work#3-salary-and-experience-by-developer-type).
